# Zappy GUI

## Goal
The Zappy GUI is a graphical visualization tool for the Zappy game server. It allows users to connect to a running Zappy server and observe the game world, players, resources, and teams in real time. The GUI provides both 2D and 3D visualization modes, as well as various panels for player, tile, and team information.

## Installation

### Dependencies:
- [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) (graphics library)
- C++17 compatible compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Make

### Build:
```sh
cd gui
make
```
This will produce the `zappy_gui` executable in the `gui/` directory.

## Running the GUI

You can run the GUI in two modes:
- **Offline mode:** (no server connection, mock data)
- **Online mode:** (connects to a Zappy server)

### Command
```sh
./zappy_gui -p <port> -h <hostname> [-2d]
```

### Parameters
- `-p <port>`: Port number of the Zappy server
- `-h <hostname>`: Hostname or IP address of the Zappy server
- `-2d`: (Optional) Run in 2D mode (default is 3D)

### Examples:
- Run in 3D mode (default):
  ```sh
  ./zappy_gui -p 4242 -h localhost
  ```
- Run in 2D mode:
  ```sh
  ./zappy_gui -p 4242 -h 127.0.0.1 -2d
  ```
- Run in offline mode (mock data):
  ```sh
  ./zappy_gui
  ```
